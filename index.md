## Welcome to my Portfolio!

This will serve as an active document for the current projects I am working on. 
These project will consist of both academia projects and open source contributions.

### About me

Currently a Junior in college pursuing my degree in Computer Science. My background is
in industrial robotics and Manufacturing. I have a passion for machine learning and 
autonomy. Most of my project will be catered towards these interests.

### Python

#### Basic linear regression
In my public repositories is a Jupyter Notebook python3 file that does some basic data
manipulation and regression model on a housing data set. This is my first go with the python
programming language and I was thrilled how insightful it was to work with big data for the 
first time.

### Support or Contact

All of the projects on this page will be maintained and serviced by me and I will actively work on them as needs
arise.
